# ✨ Onboarding

Now that you have met all the prerequisites, we can begin onboarding.  Resourcely has built-in onboarding steps to make it easy for you to get started. In this section, we will cover the onboarding process which includes:

* [setup-company-hierarchy.md](setup-company-hierarchy.md "mention") (Adding your company and setting up the organizational hierarchy)
* [source-code-management-integration](source-code-management-integration/ "mention") (Integrating a Source Control Management (SCM) platform)
* [api-access-token-generation.md](api-access-token-generation.md "mention") (Generate a token for use in CI/CD)
* [ci-cd-setup](ci-cd-setup/ "mention") (Setting up the Resourcely CI/CD Job)
