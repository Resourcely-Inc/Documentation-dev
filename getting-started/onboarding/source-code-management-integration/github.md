# üê± GitHub

Let‚Äôs get started with integrating GitHub with Resourcely. This step entails:

* Adding the Resourcely GitHub App to your GitHub Organization
* Configuring a Webhook for Resourcely
* Choosing a Repository for Resourcely to Monitor

## Adding the Resourcely App to your GitHub Organization

The Resourcely GitHub App is used to manage automated pull requests generated by Resourcely. Press the **Connect to GitHub** button to configure change management with GitHub.

You can now connect to GitHub by pressing the **Connect to GitHub** button. You will be redirected to the GitHub login.

After logging in, a new page will open up allowing you to select where you want to install the resourcelybot GitHub App. Here you should select the GitHub organization you will be integrating with Resourcely.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you don't have permission to complete the installation of the Resourcely GitHub App, you can ask your admin for an installation ID.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now that you have selected the appropriate GitHub Organization, you can further select which repositories you want Resourcely to watch.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Resourcelybot GitHub App requires **Read** access to _**members and metadata**_, and **Read and Write** access to _checks, code, issues, organization hooks, pull requests, and repository hooks._\
\
**Note:** _Only_ the repository that will leverage Resourcely for infrastructure provisioning is required
{% endhint %}

Then press the **Install & Authorize** button to proceed. The Resourcely GitHub App is installed in your organization.

You can verify the App was installed by [navigating to installed GitHub Apps settings](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-modifying-installed-github-apps#navigating-to-the-github-app-you-want-to-review-or-modify). To learn more about GitHub Apps, see the following documentation:

## Configuring a GitHub Webhook for Resourcely

GitHub Webhooks deliver notifications to an external web server whenever a defined event occurs on GitHub. To proceed to configure a GitHub webhook, click on the **GitHub webhook Settings** link and copy over the **Payload URL** and **Webhook secret token** provided in the following dialogue:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-20 at 7.33.14‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create GitHub Webhook</p></figcaption></figure>

You must then configure the webhook with the following settings:

* **Content type:** application/json
* **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook:** Let me select individual events
  * **Event triggers:** Pull Requests, Pull Request Reviews

{% hint style="info" %}
All other webhook settings can remain unchanged.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-09-01 at 1.31.58 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>GitHub Webhook event triggers</p></figcaption></figure>

Once the webhook has been properly set up, scroll down to the bottom of the page and press the **Add webhook** button. You can now see that the webhook was added successfully.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 1.32.57 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Active Webhooks</p></figcaption></figure>

Then head back to the Resourcely window and press the **Continue** button to proceed.

## Choosing a Repository for Resourcely to Monitor

You must now choose the repository that hosts your Terraform code. This is the repository in which Resourcely will watch for commits and pull requests.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-20 at 7.34.52‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Choose a repository</p></figcaption></figure>

Press the **Add a repository** button and select a repository from the dropdown.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only repositories you have access to in your GitHub Organization will be listed.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 12.33.11‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Select a repository from the list</p></figcaption></figure>

You can add more repositories to monitor by pressing the **Add repository** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
To begin onboarding, only one repository is needed. However, you have the flexibility to add more later.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 12.33.32‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Repository selected</p></figcaption></figure>

Press the **Publish** button to continue. You should now see that GitHub has been successfully integrated with Resourcely.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 12.33.40‚ÄØPM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>GitHub integrated into Change Managment</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If Auto-approve is toggled on, if guardrail validation passes on a pull-request it will be auto-approved.
{% endhint %}

Now that Resoucely has been fully integrated into GitHub, we must add the Resourcely CI/CD action to our project for Resourcely to validate our infrastructure resources. Proceed to [api-access-token-generation.md](../api-access-token-generation.md "mention")
