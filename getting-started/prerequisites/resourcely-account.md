# Resourcely Account

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to obtain a Resourcely account you must [contact our team](https://www.resourcely.io/#contact) directly or [schedule a meeting ](https://www.resourcely.io/#demo)to obtain more information.

**Note:** This process will change as our product matures.
{% endhint %}

Our team will provision a Resourcely account for you. The only requirements before provisioning an account are valid [single-sign-on-sso.md](single-sign-on-sso.md "mention")specifications. Once you log in to Resourcely, you will need to go through [onboarding](../onboarding/ "mention") before you can get started.

### Roles

You will be assigned either an **Admin** or **Developer** role when a Resourcely account is provisioned for you. Before a **Developer** can log in, the **Admin** must go through [onboarding](../onboarding/ "mention"). The role permissions are as follows:

| Action                                                 | Developer | Admin |
