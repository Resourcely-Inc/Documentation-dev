# Source Code Management

Source Code Management (SCM) platforms are used in order to track changes made to your source code. These platforms also enable automation in order to perform a particular action whenever a change is being proposed. Resourcely requires integration with an SCM platform in order to:

* Verify that Guardrail criteria are being met
* Prevent misconfigured resources from being provisioned
* Assign reviewers to proposed infrastructure code changes

Resourcely supports both [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). Both SCM solutions provide a platform to get you started with storing code, running CI/CD pipelines, reviewing code changes, and much more. To learn how to configure your SCM solution for usage with Resourcely, click on the appropriate link:
