# üê± GitHub Actions

After you have created a Pull Request with a request to provision infrastructure it will be available in Resourcely's Pull Request management screen. You can click on the **View PR** button to be transported to Pull Request within GitHub.

Once you are at the GitHub PR, you can see that Resourcely has added all the information from the Context provided when generating a resource from a blueprint.

If we scroll down we can see the Resourcely CI Job running alongside the Terraform Plan job. The Resourcely CI Job performs the following actions:

1. Waits for a Terraform to create a plan
2. Downloads the Terraform plan
3. Validates the Terraform plan against the defined Resourcely Guardrails

If a guardrail violation is detected, an appropriate reviewer from your GitHub Team is assigned to the PR. The PR will be blocked from being merged until any reviewer in your GitLab team approves.

You can dive into the job output to see the changes that violate your organization's guardrails. You can either address the violations or get your PR approved by someone in your GitLab Team.

The above shows an S3 naming convention violation which can be resolved by using the correct naming convention or getting approval from a member of the assigned GitHub Team.
