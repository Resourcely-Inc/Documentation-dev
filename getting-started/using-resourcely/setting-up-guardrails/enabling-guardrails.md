# Enabling Guardrails

Resourcely provides a catalog with a wide set of available guardrails which can be further configured. You can see all guardrails available to you by clicking on the **Guardrails** tab in Resourcely's navigation menu.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The guardrails available in the catalog must be enabled by someone with a Resourcely **Admin** role
{% endhint %}

You must determine what guardrail you would like to enable, highlight it, and then click on the **Activate** button. You can sort by **Provider**, and **Category** as well as **Search** for an available guardrail.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can learn more about the guardrail by clicking directly on it.
{% endhint %}

The guardrails you have enabled can be later applied to an appropriate Blueprint.
